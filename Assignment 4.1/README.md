### Assignment 4.1
Create a string concatenation alghorithm in java.               
This algorithm should work for arrays entered in the wrong order. For this to work right i implemented a sorting algorithm first and a concatination algortihm as a second.                 
For web interface i used springboot and for database i used MongoDB everything else is in Java.
